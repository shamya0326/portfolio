<p> My Name is Shamya Ware i'm 16 years old and this is my first year in Girls Who Code. I enjoyed it alot more than I expected, considering the fact that this is someting i'd never see myself doing. During my weeks in this program i found myself in many difficult situations. I gave frustrated alot when things got hard, but the people here in GWC were always supportive and helped me when i didn't understand what I was doing.</p>
<p> I met 16 amazing girls this summer who I feel i'll have a long lasting relationship with. The enviornment was so friendly, it ws so easy to talk to them
