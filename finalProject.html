<p> My Name is Shamya Ware i'm 16 years old and this is my first year in Girls Who Code. I enjoyed it alot more than I expected, considering the fact that this is someting i'd never see myself doing. During my weeks in this program i found myself in many difficult situations. I gave frustrated alot when things got hard, but the people here in GWC were always supportive and helped me when i didn't understand what I was doing.</p>
<p> I met 16 amazing girls this summer who I feel i'll have a long lasting relationship with. The enviornment was so open and friendly, it was so easy to talk to them. We were able to laugh and joke about pretty much everything. </p>
<p> I learned alot in this program. I was able to get out of my comfort zone and do many different things, like I mentioned before, that I never thought i'd do in my lifetime. Although I didn't start at the same time the other girls did i was still able to quickly catch up and get on the same page as everyone else. </P>
<P> I was able to test the waters in many laanguages such as Python, HTML, Java Script, Django, CSS and Obamicon</p>
<p> Using these languages I was able to create a webpage which im very proud of. Making the webpage was handsdown my favorite part of this summer program. I caught on to the coding really quickly. I was also able to recolor a picture of "The Weeknd" and i was able to do many more pictures after that one.
